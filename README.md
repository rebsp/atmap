# ATMAP Library

This is a simple script which implements the Eurocontrol ATMAP weather algorithm: https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/algorithm-met-technical-note.pdf


Requires [AVWX engine](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine) for parsing the observations.

Pretty bad code without following any best practices (as it had to be quick), PR's accepted if you want to contribute.
